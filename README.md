# improved-government-forms
A better version for governmental forms we all need to avail various services. 

I was prompted to start this repository when I had to recently fill out a form to avail some governmental service. This form like many forms we have all come across during our lives had a lot of scope for improvement - not only in terms of typesetting but from a spellchecking and grammar pov too. There is no reason for governemental forms to be from the typewritter era in the year 2020. 

I invite you to contribute versions of governmental forms that you end up recreating to this repo. In order to keep it current, please update the table below with the date of when a particular form was last accepted at a government office without a hitch.

Let's bring all forms to 2020!

Form purpose | Official form name | Colloquial form name | Date it was last accepted. | Link to official information | Link to form in the repo
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Marriage registeration | Notice of marriage intent | - | December 2020. | - | [Notice of intended marriage](https://github.com/Ketcomp/improved-government-forms/blob/main/marriage-registeration/Notice%20of%20intended%20marriage.docx)
